# Speedometer
Arduino project using an Arduino Uno, a 7-segment serial display, a hall effect sensor, and a neodymiun magnet

This arduino project will serve as a speedometer for any vehicle with round wheels when given the tire's circumference.


**diameter needs to be given in mile
Circumference = 2*radius*pi = diameter*pi
Rate = number of rotations per second
Speed(in mph) = Rate*Circumference*3600
